Includes: setTimeout , setInterval and XHR .\n10 May 2024\n15:45\nSchriften\nRendering never happens while the engine executes a task. It doesn\u2019t matter if the task takes a long time. Changes to the DOM are painted only after the task is complete.\n\nRender will be blocked until microtasks are finished so therefore also render will be blocked when you use lots of promises or it has heavy logic inside it\n15:56\nqueueMicrotask is a new browser API which can be used to convert your synchronous code into async.\n\ndiffernece with setTimeout/setInterval\nqueueMicrotask will execute microtask in a same queue after all sync microtasks are executed but setTimeout/interval execute tasks in a separate queue (macrotask queue) and because of that these tasks may not execute right after current task completes:\n\nhttps://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@kondareddy_yaramala/understanding-the-power-of-queuemicrotask-webapi-in-javascript-an-in-depth-analysis-eda07eb18009#:~:text=queueMicrotask%20is%20different%20from%20other,after%20the%20current%20task%20completes.\n20:48\nSchriften\nThings like HTTP Requests for AJAX, setTimeout are async (macro or micro) they dont live inside js engine they live in web api env.\nwhen we call them on js, their call back move them in the web api env and they wait until they\'re done, then based on priorities (macro - micro, etc) return to the queue and their callback will execute\n22:46\nSchriften\nconst [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\nreturn (\n<>\n\n<h1>{number}</h1>\n<button onClick={() => {\nsetNumber(number + 1);\nsetNumber(number + 1);\nsetNumber(number + 1);\n}}>+3</button>\n</>\n)\n}\n\nReact waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates.\nthis feaure of react lets us update multiple states wihout trigerring too many re renderening. it batches all state updates in one re render. this feat called batching\n\n- Setting state does not change the variable in the existing render, but it requests a new render.\n- React processes state updates after event handlers have finished running. This is called batching.\n- To update some state multiple times in one event, you can use setNumber(n => n + 1) updater function.\n\ntheory:\nreact first run all the setStates in a handler (add them to the queue one by one) and then after compeleting the handler, it starts re rendering and changing states from reading and executing the queue.\n\nhttps://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates\n15 May 2024\n01:16\nSchriften\nregular func can be called before initiallazation cause they will be hoisted and go on top of their scope.\nbut arrow func since they have to be assigned to a variable, they can not hoist to the top of the scope as a function.\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-arrow-functions-and-normal-functions/#:~:text=//%20ReferenceError%3A%20Cannot%20access%20%27printName%27%20before%20initialization\n17 May 2024\n16:38\nSchriften\nthis is not a property of the function or the object directly; instead, it is a special binding that depends on how the function is invoked.\nthis in js reffers to the context in which the func (that this is used there) called.\n21 May 2024\n17:48\nSchriften\nuseState is not async!:\nIn fact, setCount does its job synchronously. However, the updated value doesn\'t immediately reflect in the count variable because React batches state updates for performance reasons. This means the count variable isn\'t updated until the next render\n19:15\nSchriften\nBatching Updates: React batches multiple state updates that occur within the same event loop iteration to improve performance. This means that if you call setCount multiple times within the same function execution, React will only perform one re-render with the final state value.\n19:19\njs has two phases:\n1 - creating executuin context (compiling - hoisting - creating lexical scop env - memory allocation )\n2 - execution\n\nthe hoisting occurs in the first phase\n22 May 2024\n00:19\nSchriften\nhow preseving state in react:\nReact ensures that state updates are preserved between re-renders of the component. Even if the component function is called multiple times (e.g., due to re-renders triggered by parent component updates), the state remains consistent because it\'s associated with the component instance\n16:51\nSchriften\ndifference between OOP and FP\nFP emphasizes the use of pure functions, where the output is solely dependent on the input and has no side effects.\n\nin OOP we re using the logic by object inheritance concept. class can accept props of other class.\nin FP we re using code by creating higher order func: funcs that receive other funcs as arguments or retun them as result\n\nin FP we could use recursion over itration and make a loop by calling a func instide it instead of useing loop explicitly\n\nOOP uses mutable state within objects.\nFP uses immutable state and pure functions.\n\nOOP achieves reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.\nFP achieves reusability through function composition and higher-order functions.\n\npolymorphism: it allows an object to be an instance of its parent class. this concept lets us extent a loginc of a class to another classes.\nfunction composition: it allows us to combine functions for creating new function and more complicated logics. in composition, the output of a func could use as in input for antoher function.\n17:29\nSchriften\nwhen we use composition manually:\n\nconst add = x => x + 2;\nconst multiply = x => x \\* 3;\n\n// Function composition manually\nconst addThenMultiply = x => multiply(add(x));\n\nconsole.log(addThenMultiply(5));\n17:33\nwhen we use higher order functions for function compostion:\n\nconst add = x => x + 2;\nconst multiply = x => x \\* 3;\n\ncomposer = x => firstFunc(secFunct(x));\naddThenMultiply = composer(add,nultiply)\n\nconsole.log(addThenMultiply(5);\n17:47\ncodes in oop is mutable but in fp the best prctice is unmutablity. this is critical to a func to remain pure (result of a func should be separated from the input and input must be isolaited)\n18:07\nSchriften\nWhenever a component\'s state or props change, React triggers reconciliation.\nThe Reconciliation Process:\n\nNew Virtual DOM Creation: React creates a new virtual DOM reflecting the updated state or props.\nDiffing the Virtual DOMs: React compares the previous virtual DOM with the new one to identify the minimal set of changes required.\nUpdating the Real DOM: Based on the differences, React updates the real DOM efficiently.

long running tasks to the browser and when we call those apis we just initiate the offloading.\n\nwhats the task of event loop?\nit checks if the call stack is empty. if nothing is running it gets the first available tasks from the tasks queue and gives it to the call stack and so on.\n\nso if there are tasks running in the callstack , async tasks should wait in the queue even they\'re done.

sideEffect and update the ui so user can see the ui updates.\n\nuseLayoutEffect is sync. after all dom mutaion is complete, it will block the screen from updating until all sideEffect performed then ui updates and screen will repaint.\nuseLAyout useCase is when we want to add some loginc to measure layout or add some thing which affects the ui-layout and its better to add it before ui update.\n\nso useEffect is async and it will not block the ui from update.\nuse layout is sync and it will block ui from update until all effect is perormed in Dom\n\nThe effects exsiting in useEffect

differnece\nwe use useMemo to memoized a return value and result of a functionaity. useMemo ensures that a re-calclation of an expencive logic only happens when the dependecies changed.\nalso we use it when the drived state (the state we\'re passing it to the child component and want to make some calculation on that in a child) only re run when this state changed.\nthen we use useMemo to prevent recalculation of an expencive logic on every re-render.\n\nconst expensiveCalculation = (num) => {\nconsole.log(\'Calculating...\');\nreturn num \\* 2;\n};\n\nconst MyComponent = ({ number }) => {\nconst memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(number), [number]);\n\nreturn <div>{memoizedValue}</div>;\n};\n\nuseCallBack:\nwe use useCallback to memoize a functionality it self and for example pass it to a child component.\nuseCallback ensures that a function only be called when one of its dependecies changed:\n\n//in a parent component we wrote a memoized onClik func:\nconst memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {\ndoSomething(a, b);\n}, [a, b]);\n\n//in a child component we passed this memoized onClick func. it calls only whe the value of this eventHandler changed.\nconst MyComponent = ({ value }) => {\nconst handleClick = useCallback(() => {\nconsole.log(value);\n}, [value]);\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n};\n\n#here\n14:00\nSchriften\nBoth useMemo and useCallback can be used to optimize performance in a React (or Next.js) application by memoizing values and functions respectively, and their use cases can sometimes overlap\n14:04\noverusing memoization: Each memoized value or function is stored in memory, which could lead to increased memory usage if overused.\n18:14\nSchriften\nwhere axactly useMemo and useCallback cashe the value or func:\nwhen in react each eleement or component has a fiber node. fiber node represents each component in react strucutre. when we\'re passing a value/prop/func to a component , react attaches these props to its related fiber node and preserve it for differeing them from old and new version.\n18:18\nwhen a react comp is mounted, react create a fiber node for it. then when the hook is called, react attaches the value or funcs to its fiber.\nwhen the deps are not changed, react use the same value or func in fiber node in re rendering process. when the deps have changed, react re cacualte the funcs or call the func again and update the fiber node\n.\n18:33\nSchriften\nOn the initial render, React creates the function and stores it in the fiber node.\nOn subsequent renders, React checks [value]\n18:41\noverusing memoization leads to:\nIncreased Garbage Collection Activity.\nMemory

the dom element when they\'re mounted or updated.\nwe use refs when we want to access some elment/components props or methods which are not accesible in the components props.\ni.e we use refs when we want to access the underlying methods of dom elements or dom it self or instances of them.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\nconst myRef = useRef(null);\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\nmyRef.current.focus();\n};\n\nreturn (\n<>\n<input type="text" ref={myRef} />\n<button onClick={handleClick}>Focus input</button>\n</>\n);\n}\n20:23\nSchriften\nhow useRef works:\nconst ref = useRef(null)\n\nwhen we call the useRef and asgin it to a var, it return a mutable obj with a prop named current which we can set any value to it.\nin the above case, we use the myRef as a refference to a dom element, so the current obj can access the dom element methods.\nin this case, current reffers to input element and its method i.e focus.\n20:38\nSchriften\ncallBackRefs:\nwe can wirte a func and pass it as a ref to an element instead of using useRef.\nwe write a setter func which get an element as an arg and asgin it to variable.\nwhen we pass this setter fun to an element, this element asgin to that variable and then we could use that var inside another func to access its underlying dom methods:\n\nlet ref = null;\n\nfunction setRef(element) {\nref = element;\n}\nfunction handle() {\nif (ref) {\nref.focus();\n}\n}\n\n  <input className=\'bg-v2-text-low_em w-1/2 mr-10\' ref={setRef} />\n      <ButtonV2 onClick={handle}>ddd</ButtonV2>\n20:46\nwhen we could use callbackRefs:\nwhen

sideEffect on component life cycle:\nwe can make some action this way when component mounted or unmounted. we could pass the seterFunc as a ref only when the component is mounted.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\nconst [showInput, setShowInput] = useState(false);\n\nconst handleToggle = () => setShowInput(!showInput);\n\nconst setRef = (element) => {\nif (element) {\n// Element is being mounted\nelement.focus();\n} else {\n// Element is being unmounted\nconsole.log(\'Element is unmounting\');\n}\n};\n\nreturn (\n<>\n<button onClick={handleToggle}>Toggle Input</button>\n{showInput && <input type="text" ref={setRef} />}\n</>\n);\n}\n\nprevent stale clousure\nwhen some data that must be updated during re-render , remains the same. this could happen when we use useRef. since useRef creates an obj that persist across re-renders. but with custom ref / callback ref we could prevent this , cause the func always calls after re-render and gives us the last instance of the refferencing element.\n21:19\nSchriften\nwhen useRef called?\nuseRef call on rendering phase and with every re-render.\non the initial render , it calls in this phase and sets the value to the initial value (null in our case) . then react recocile the dom and v dom and then the commit phase starts. in this phase react commit the changes from v-dom to actual dom. in this phase react asign the ref courrent prop to the refferenced element in dom.\n\nthen useRef calls in rendering phase (set to null), it updates the current on commit phase(with element).(this is related to initial render) .\non every re-render the current asigned value persist. so when the useRef calls on rendering phase in every re-render it returns the same current prop.\n21:33\ncommit phase is the last phase of react reconcilation proccess. its unstopable in this phase react runs these the life cycle methods:\ncomponentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.\nassignment of ref cuurent prop occurs right before commonentDidMount /update/ called. didupdate in init render and didUpdate in re-rendering\n21:35\nuseEffect called after componentDidMount and useRef called in rendering phase and it reasigned before

It uses a highly efficient diff algorithm and can modify any subtree of the DOM.\n\n- render(): This is one of the most important methods of ReactDOM. This function is used to render a single React Component or several Components wrapped together in a Component or a div element.\n\n- findDOMNode(): This function is generally used to get the DOM node where a particular React component was rendered. This method is very less used like the following can be done by adding a ref attribute to each component itself.\n\n- unmountComponentAtNode(): This function is used to unmount or remove the React Component that was rendered to a particular container.\n\n- hydrate(): This method is equivalent to the render() method but is implemented while using server-side rendering.\n\n- createPortal(): It allow us to render a component into a DOM node that resides outside the current DOM hierarchy of the parent component.\n\nReact\n\n- Whenever we use component, classes, elements, etc. We\u2019re using React\n  21:00\n  reactDom.render is deprecated and replaced with reactDom.createRoot((document.getElementById(\'root\')).render(<App/>)\n  because of these changes we could use new feats of react 18.\n  ReactDOM.hydrate(): In React 18, hydrate has been replaced by hydrateRoot(), which aligns with the createRoot() API.\n  3 September 2024\n  00:45\n  Schriften\n  the most important feat of react 18 is the Concurrent Rendering i think. it allows react to differ urgent and non-urgent task and allows browser to be interactive to user action event when some tasks are in process. this means rendering after setting a state wont block the thread and user is still able to click some btn and trigger an event.\n  to reach this we could use some hook like useTransition:\n\nimport React, { useState, useTransition } from \'react\';\nimport { createRoot } from \'react-dom/client\';\n\n// A component that generates a large list of numbers\nfunction SlowList({ count }) {\nconst items = [];\nfor (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\nitems.push(<li key={i}>Item {i + 1}</li>);\n}\nreturn <ul>{items}</ul>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Urgent state\nconst [listCount, setListCount] = useState(0); // Non-urgent state\n\n// Hook to manage transitions (non-urgent updates)\nconst [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n// Handle button click - this is an urgent update\nconst handleButtonClick = () => {\nsetCount(count + 1); // Urgent update\n};\n\n// Handle list rendering - this is a non-urgent update\nconst handleSlowUpdate = () => {\nstartTransition(() => {\nsetListCount(5000); // Non-urgent update, can be deferred\n});\n};\n\nreturn (\n\n<div>\n<h1>Concurrent Rendering Example</h1>\n<button onClick={handleButtonClick}>\nIncrement Count (Urgent): {count}\n</button>\n<br />\n<button onClick={handleSlowUpdate} disabled={isPending}>\nRender Large List (Non-Urgent)\n</button>\n{isPending && <p>Loading...</p>}\n<SlowList count={listCount} />\n</div>\n);\n}\n\n// Render the App using createRoot (Concurrent mode enabled)\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\'root\'));\nroot.render(<App />);\n4 September 2024\n22:43\nSchriften\nenum in ts:\nwe can use them for keeping set of primative values:\n\nexport enum Status {\nIdle = \'IDLE\',\nLoading = \'LOADING\',\nSuccess = \'SUCCESS\',\nError = \'ERROR\',\n}\n\nconst [status, setStatus] = useState<Status>(Status.Idle);\n5 September 2024\n01:09\nSchriften\nnamespace:\nwe use them for grouping set of data togather and use them whrere needed:\n\nnamespace MyNamespace {\nexport const greeting = \'Hello, World!\';\n\nexport function sayHello() {\nconsole.log(greeting);\n}\n\nexport interface User {\nname: string;\nage: number;\n}\n}\n\n// Using the namespace\nMyNamespace.sayHello();\n14:48\nSchriften\nAdjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.\nwe must to wrap the multiple elements inside an element or fragment, cause jsx transpile to Js func and we can not retrun two funcs in js.\n23:22\nSchriften\nabout currying:\nwhen a func accept to params, we can convert it to accept only one param at the time and returning anohter func with the other param.\nwe could use this mehtod when we want to store a value and use it in different places.

event handling. because of that we could write event handlers that are unaware of the browser target.\nto do this react introduced the synthetic event. an obj that wrap the orginal rvent provided by browser with same props.\n\nmeans in react we dont have to use the window prrop eventListener. cause the events are catched in react and we could get them as a syntheticEvents prop.\n\nconst handleClick = (syntheticEvent) => {\n//nativeEvent is the browser native event and we could even reach it in react!\nconsole.log(syntheticEvent.nativeEvent instanceof MouseEvent)\nconsole.log(syntheticEvent.type === \'click\')\n//...\n}\n8 September 2024\n19:32\nSchriften\nevent pooling in react:\nin plain js when we create an eventHandler and use it for a btn onclick for example, this handler create a new event obj every time the btn clicked and this is heavy and talke a lot memory. so react create an cross-browser obj named synethetic event which wrappes around the event obj. when we create a handler and pass the event (syntetich event in here) to it, it calls and triggers the event. after the event finishes running it clears all the props of this obj to null and make it reusable for the next time.\nto prevent this event pooling we could use event.persist()\n\nimport React from \'react\';\n\nfunction EventPoolingExample() {\nconst handleClick = (event) => {\n//when we uncommet this we could persist the event obj\n// event.persist()\n// Here, React will pool the event after this function runs\nconsole.log(event.type); // Works here\nsetTimeout(() => {\n// The event properties will be cleared before this runs\nconsole.log(event.type); // Will likely be `null` or cause an error\n}, 1000);\n};\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;\n}\n\nexport default EventPoolingExample;\n\nEvent pooling has been deprecated in React 17+\n20:16\nSchriften\nevent delegation in react\nreact does not attach a listener in to each element and the func handlers will not directly call in react. instead react uses a top level event listener which has been set on the top of the project (document or root)\n\nimport React from \'react\';\n\nfunction List() {\nconst handleItemClick = (event) => {\nalert(`Item clicked: ${event.target.textContent}`);\n};\n\nreturn (\n\n<ul onClick={handleItemClick}>\n<li>Item 1</li>\n<li>Item 2</li>\n<li>Item 3</li>\n</ul>\n);\n}\n\nexport default Listt\n\nin this case when we click on one of the li, this click event bubble up to the dom, to that top level listenrer (the handler is not called yet). in this point react wrapps this event iside the ssynthetd event and starts to find the related elment then it calls its handler whith the correct syntetich event prop\n9 September 2024\n23:43\nSchriften\nan important difference between synthetic and native events is the performance.\nnative events might be set separatly in each element with a handler and these events are unique objs an have their specified space in memory and remains until garbage collection. instead\nSynthetic Events: Designed to optimize performance

about css codes but webpack turn(bundle) css to js module and inject it in to js module system. it does that helping loaders.\nthe most imprtant loader is:\ncss-loader: without it react doestnt understand import styles.css file in a component. css-loader tranform the css content (@import to require) to js module and export it as string and inject it to the dom.\n\nstyle-loader: this loader inject css to the dom via a <style> tag. its useful for dev mode because giving the reatime updating css changes but not recommended in production mode because of making bundle larger and preventthe caching css.\n\nmini-css-extract-plugin: this loader replaced with style-loader(production) and extarcats css from js in to separate .css file. this is important for production because it allows browser to load css in parrallel with js and cache it.\n\nin style-loader, css is embeded in to js and that make a huge bundle but because of this embeding it allows us a real-time css updates.\n\nso:\n\n- the css-loader is for bundling css file in to js\n- style-loader and mini-css-extract-plugin is for injecting css file to the dom. one in <style> tag and one in separate .css

instead if rendering all the html content and then send it to the client, this method allows us to render content part by part and send it part by part to the client.\nhis means the browser can start displaying the page\'s content bit by bit, improving the user experience.\nOnce the full HTML is rendered and sent, React can take over on the client side to "hydrate" the app, attaching event listeners and making the page interactive.\n\nimport { renderToPipeableStream } from \'react-dom/server\';\nimport App from \'./App\'; // Your main React component\n\nconst server =

which updates happen. Instead, it defers the value update until the UI has finished rendering more critical updates.

With it, we can explicitly mark some state updates and the re-rendering caused by them as "non-critical"\n\nAs a result, React will calculate these updates in the "background" instead of blocking the main task. If something "critical" happens (i.e., a normal state update), React will pause its "background" rendering, execute the critical update, and then either return to the previous task or abandon it completely and start a new one.\n19:03\nuseTransition , deferredValue, or suspence is two other ways of concurret rendering\n\nexport default function App() {\nconst [tab, setTab] = useState(\'issues\');\n\n// add the useTransition hook\nconst [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\nreturn (\n\n<div className="container">\n<div className="tabs">\n...\n<TabButton\n// indicate that the content is loading\nisLoading={isPending}\nonClick={() => {\n// call setTab inside a function\n// that is passed to startTransition\nstartTransition(() => {\nsetTab(\'projects\');\n});\n}}\nname="Projects"\n/>\n...\n</div>\n...\n</div>\n);\n}\n29 October 2024\n23:34\nSchriften\nabout useTransition and its downSilded\nhttps://www.developerway.com/posts/use-transition\n30 October 2024\n21:26\nSchriften\nabout throttle in js and react:\nsimple explaination is: throttle specified how many time can a func be called in a specific time. i,e when we set a dely to 1 sec, the func can be called only one sec after its last call no matter how many time we trigger it.\nin js:\n\nfunction throttle(cb, delay) {\nlet lastCall = 0;\n\nreturn function (...args) {\nconst now = new Date().getTime();\nif (now - lastCall >= delay) {\nlastCall = now;\nreturn cb(...args);\n}\nreturn null;\n};\n}\n\nthrottle in react as a hook:\n\nfunction useThrottle(cb, delay) {\nconst lastCall = useRef(0);\n// also you can create another ref and pass the simple func wuth args to the current method of i\n// instead of useCallBack\nconst throttledCB = useCallback(\n(...args) => {\nconst now = new Date().getTime();\n\n      if (now - lastCall >= delay) {\n        lastCall.current = now;\n        return cb(...args);\n      }\n      return null;\n    },\n    [cb, delay]\n\n);\n\nreturn throttledCB;\n}\n31 October 2024\n16:50\nSchriften\nabout debounce:\ndebounce lets us to call a func after user stops an action and the time has reached to the sepecified dely.\nin throtteling the time is fixed we set a delay and the func will be called after the delay is over no matter if the user is still in action or not. but in debouncing, the time is reset after each user actions and the func never be called unless user stops trigerring the action and the time reached to delay.\n\ndeboincing in JS\n\nfunction debounce(cb, delay) {\nlet timer;\nreturn function (...args) {\nclearTimeout(timer);\ntimer = setTimeout(() => {\ncb(...args);\n}, delay);\n};\n}\n\ndebouncing in react:\n\nfunction useDebounce(cb, delay) {\nconst timeoutRef = useRef(0);\nconst debouncedFunc = useCallback(\n(...args) => {\nif (timeoutRef.current) {\nclearTimeout(timeoutRef.current);\n}\n\n      timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {\n        cb(...args);\n      }, [delay]);\n    },\n    [delay, cb]\n\n);\nreturn debouncedFunc;\n}\n16:54\n\ud83d\udc46 throttle vs debounce for last fuckin time \ud83d\udc46\n1 November 2024\n01:43\nSchriften\ndo performant animgation.\navoid using css pops in animating which trigger painitng or layout. we can experiment that by chrome dev tools. performance tap, record and see the rendering percentage and animation frame.\nwe must always use transform or opacity related props. something other than them should use very carrefully because of paint and layout triggering.\n01:43\nThese four steps are known as the browser\'s rendering pipeline.\n1- Style: Calculate the styles that apply to the elements.\n2- Layout: Generate the geometry and position for each element.\n3- Paint: Fill out the pixels for each element into layers.\n4- Composite: Draw the layers to the screen.\n01:58\nCSS vs JavaScript performance\nYou might wonder: is it better from a performance perspective to use CSS or JavaScript for animations?\n\nCSS-based animations, and Web Animations (in the browsers that support the API), are typically handled on a thread known as the compositor thread. This is different from the browser\'s main thread, where styling, layout, painting, and JavaScript are executed. This means that if the browser is running some expensive tasks on the main thread, these animations can keep going without being interrupted.\n\nAs explained in this article, other changes to transforms and opacity can, in many cases, also be handled by the compositor thread.\n\nIf any animation triggers paint, layout, or both, the main thread will be required to do work. This is true for both CSS and JavaScript animations\n\nhttps://web.dev/articles/animations-overview\n02:01\ntransorm and opacity animations affect composite step and take less works agains width or heitg or top or bottom which are a layout related props\n20:04\nSchriften\nabout will-change in css:\n\n- this property can be used in situations when an animated element will be repated constantly or regulary.\n- with setting that we\'re teling the browser that the element will change soon so it keeps the optimization of the animation for next time.\n\nin fact,\n\n- by default browser makes for transform and opacity a new layer and remove it automatically by ending the process.\n- with will-change , after an animation accures, browser create and persist a new rendering layer.\n- thats why we should use thi prop carefully. it creats and keep new layer for each element with this prop\n- creating too many layers can cause performace issues.\n- with will-change we could persist the animation-transtion layer\n  3 November 2024\n  23:05\n  Schriften\n  About react router\n\nBrowserRouter sets up the application\'s navigation context, while Route defines individual routes, and Switch ensures only one route is rendered at a time\n23:22\nSchriften\nAbout routGuard\n\n// In a component\nimport { Route, Redirect } from \'react-router-dom\';\n\nfunction PrivateRoute({ children, isAuthenticated }) {\nreturn (\n<Route\nrender={({ location }) =>\nisAuthenticated ?

An element inside one stacking context can never be compared against elements in another.\nWe can still achieve the desired result, however, with a bit of out-of-the-box\\* thinking.\n(means we bring tooltip out of the main) we could do such thing in react bt creating portal.\n\nWhen a stacking context is created, it \u201cflattens\u201d all of its descendants. Those children can still be rearranged internally, but we\'ve essentially locked those children in\n\nAbout isolation:\nWhen we apply this declaration to an element, it does precisely 1 thing: it creates a new stacking context.\n\nWith so many different ways to create a stacking context, why do we need another one? Well, with every other method, stacking contexts are created implicitly, as the result of some other change. isolation creates a stacking context in the purest way possible: don\'t need pos zindex, filter, flex zindex and....\n13 May 2025\n20:17\nSchriften\nDiff merge and rebase\nIn merge the history will not be rewritten, it takes all next the steps of the main and merges with the feat branch that created from two steps before of the main and add a new commit for this.\n\nRebase take the whole branch and move it on top of the main branch like the whole commits belong to the main from first.\n22:47\nSchriften\nAbout execution context:\nThe Env that js codes run and execute\n\nThree kinds of context:\nglobal context (window or global in node)\nfunctional context\nEval context\n\nIt has two phases:\nCreation: memory allocation and hosting happen here\n\nExecution phase: executing codes line by line, assigning value to variables, executing funcs\n\nMemory allocation in first phase:\nJs reserve memory for variables and then assign the real value in sec phase.\n18 May 2025\n00:05\nSchriften\nabout commonJs and tree shaking:\nif we require and use commonJs to use a file, tree shaking will not happen. because tree shaking needs to know statically which file or data is exported (its based on static analysis ) and in commomJs the require will imports the enitre module.\n00:06\nalso we cant dynamically import a commonJs module unless we make it as default export and its again a bad practice. but in a native ESM env we cant that at all undless we use createRequire()\n00:09\nHow ISR Works (Simplified)\nOn build, Next.js statically generates pages using getStaticProps.\n\nWhen a user visits a page:\n\nIf the static page exists and is fresh \u2192 it\'s served instantly.\n\nIf it\u2019s stale (based on revalidate time), a background regeneration is triggered.\n\nThe updated page is saved and served for future requests.\n\n// pages/blog/[slug].js\n\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\nconst post = await fetchPost(context.params.slug);\n\nreturn {\nprops: { post },\nrevalidate: 60, // Re-generate the page **every 60 seconds**\n};\n}\n27 May 2025\n09:38\nSchriften\nAbout docker and dockerize:\n\nDocker creates a consistent environment \u2014 it doesn\u2019t care about the developer\u2019s local setup.\n09:40\nIt keeps the node version of the app stable and ensures that the app runs in a stable and safe env.\n09:41\nAlso it is a great way for batching up the client and server side of the app and running them together locally.\nFor the we set image ports and image in the\ndocker-compose.yml file and run docker compose.\n31 May 2025\n20:43\nSchriften\nabout loading css in react vite\nin development:\nreact load all .css and module.css files in the head section inside style tags. this is render blocking but this adding gives react HMR in css codes. so react serves them as ESM and inject the style tags dynamically without bundling.\n\nin production mode:\nreact vite use rollup to bundle everything even css module or tw , it minified them, cached them and store them inside a global index-hash.css file and link it inisde a link tap on top of the project with stylesheet rel.\nthis index-hash.css is created inside dist and it changes everytime a new style is added or changed so the ui could tell something changed and update it self.\n\nTWIST: by default there is always one index.css in production after build but it could be more when we lazyloaded some comp.\nwhen such comp loaded and has some styling, the style will be add in a different index-hash.css file and be linked on top.\n4 June 2025\n02:12\nSchriften\nBuilding.Micro-Frontendsr.pdf\nNot included, change data exporting settings to download.\n9.0 MB\n7 June 2025\n21:53\nSchriften\nAbout stack and heap:\n\nStack is for storing short-lived data: func calls and funcs local variable (str number)\nA func be called and then popped of from stack, if too many func calls happens without popping of from stack (recursions) we face max call stack err.\nThis error happens after browser or node reach their call stack limit.\nIn chrome or node is between 10000 to 20000 call.
